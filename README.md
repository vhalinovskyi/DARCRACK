DARCRACK - simple, fast and tiny

This is a program written by me at one evening just for fun and education purposes. It can crack MD5, SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512 encoded passwords as fast as JohnTheRipper do, although it's just 90 lines of code. Everyone is free to utilize this piece of code for any purpose, I don't care. Thanks for your attention
